/*
Ideally have all code here to let user demo this game and other
programs in this folder (cupcake store/weatherapp)

"Live coding videos" (Maybe a seperate page, like a hyper link that says "behind the scenes"???)
Include a video timelaps looping, showing the code 
being typed in order.
The video will show an example of the code that was actually
used for the program the user is demoing
    ex: cupcake store will show the "Live coding video" of
    my coding the C# code
